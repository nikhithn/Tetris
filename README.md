# Tetris
A basic tetris implementation using pygame

In order to run this, you will need python3 with pygame configured.

For a guide on how to set-up these dependencies, please see the below link:
Set-up Python: https://docs.python.org/3/using/index.html
Set-up Pygame: https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

Once these are set-up, play the game by running
python3 main.py

You can move the piece left and right by using the arrow keys, and rotate the piece by using the up key.

Hope you enjoy it!
